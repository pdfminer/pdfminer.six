# Contributing guidelines

Any contribution is appreciated! You might want to:

* Fix spelling errors
* Improve documentation
* Add tests for untested code
* Add new features
* Fix bugs

## How can I contribute?

* Use [issues](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/issues) to report bugs and features
* Fix issues by [creating pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
* Help others giving your thoughts on open issues and pull requests.

## General guidelines for creating issues and pull requests

* Search previous issues, as yours might be a duplicate.
* When creating a new issue for a bug, include a minimal reproducible example.
* When creating a new issue for a feature, be sure to describe the context of the problem you are trying to solve. This
  will help others to see the importance of your feature request. 
* Link pull request to a single issue.
* Pull requests should be merged to develop, not master. This ensures that master always equals the released verion.  
* Include unit tests when possible. In case of bugs, this will help to prevent the same mistake in the future. In case 
  of features, this will show that your code works correctly.
* Code should work for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x (for now).
* Code changes should conform to PEP8 coding style (with a line-width of 120). Existing code may stay as it is. 
* New features should be well documented using docstrings.
* Check spelling and grammar.
